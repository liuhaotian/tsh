Test Cases: 

We will use the following test cases (and the associated test suite)
to evaluate and grade your project.  All test cases end with the
"exit" command.

1) just exit
2) single command execution
3) multiple commands, absolute and in PATH
4) pwd
5) multiple commands with more than one argument
6) cd and pwd
7) file that does not exist
8) multiple commands with more than one argument
9) cd and pwd
10) ctrl-c signal
11) ctrl-c signal

For extra credit (total 20 points):

There are 4 extra credit test cases, worth 5 points each.

12) set environment variable
13) test .tshrc with comments, commands and errors
14) test simple prompt
14) test complex prompt

Using the sdriver.pl driver script:

To automatically test your project, we use the testsuite/sdriver.pl
script to send signals to your shell.  As described in the handout,
you can run the driver from the testsuite directory:

./sdriver.pl -t testXX.in -s .././tsh

To see the output of the reference implementation, replace ".././tsh"
with "./tsh-ref".
